Task 3

For Combining results from Task 1 and Task 3

Since we assume that links with shallower depth are more important than deeper ones and
within each webpage links appearing earlier should be crawled first, we will combine the two 
lists based on level. we have two lists. List1 for Task 1 and List2 for Task 3. We will
define a variable level for the class WebCrawler which will store the depth for each link.
As we have used Breadth First Search, the order of the links in the list will be such that links 
appearing earlier in the webpage will be entered firsdt in the list. Thus we can traverse the list
in increasing order from index 0 to list length. 

The pseudocode for merging the two lists for Task 1 and Task 3 is given below.

for i in list1 and j in list2 
 till there are elements in list1 or list2 
  if list1[i].level == list2[j].level, then
   add list1[i] to list3; i++
   add list2[j] to list3; j++
  else if list1[i].level < list2[j].level, then
   add list1[i] to list3; i++
  else
   add list2[j] to list3; j++
end for
